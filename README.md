# astro-app

Application for displaying astronomy-related content provided by the NASA API, developed for the final, Capstone project of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree program 

AstroApp is an app for displaying astronomy-related content provided by the NASA API. It presents the user with a daily photo-of-the-day content and a detailed list of the closest approaching asteroids, including their name, diameter, approach date and velocity. 
Using the user's current location, it provides information about the closest observatories and their names, addresses, opening hours and photos. The user can choose to present each observatoryâ€™s location on an interactive map.
